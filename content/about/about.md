![it me](me.jpg){:.float-right style="max-width:50%"}
I'm a cat, currently freelancing in Seattle. I'm an expert in lap sitting, laser pointer chasing,
walking on keyboards, and napping. I have an award-winning purr. In addition, I have a fair amount
of familiarity with investigating closets, meowing at doors, and scratching on furniture.

I've been interested in humans since about 2008 and have worked in various locations in the Seattle
area, sometimes under _extremely_ adverse conditions, such as cohabiting with a dog. You can keep
up to date with what I'm doing by following my current employer [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/@Reedbeta).
